## ðŸ§© Architecture Overview

This project follows a modular, multi-layered architecture:

- **DTOs & Entities**: Clear separation to keep API models isolated from persistence logic.
- **Custom Mappers**: Manual mapping methods ensure full control over data transformation.
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Repository Layer**: Built using `JpaRepository` for data access and query abstraction.
- **Global Exception Handling**: Centralized error management using `@ControllerAdvice`.
- **Transaction Management**: Leveraged `@Transactional` on delete operations to ensure data consistency.
